# Instructions for Assignments
Assignment instructions and a link to the starter code will be posted here as they are released.

Assignments are due on **Sundays by 11:59 pm**. You must first push your changes to GitHub, and then copy and paste your GitHub URL into the D2L assignment text box to signal completion. **If you wish to use your late bank, include a note in the D2L submission box**.

Assignments are to be completed individually or in groups of 2. If you choose to work with a partner, you are **both responsible** for submitting a copy of the assignment with **both names** on the file(s). This is to allow you maximum flexibility to decide whether to work together or independently without needing to set up official groups in advance.
