# Instructions for Autograded Labs
Lab instructions and a link to the starer code will be posted here as they are released. All autograded labs are due by the last day of class (April 5, 2023) and are worth a total of 10%.

Each lab has a number of tests that must be passed to receive the 1% passing grade on the lab. Extra tests may also be provided for additional practice.
